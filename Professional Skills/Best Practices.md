1. Apply Early Returns
in the case that you checking for the user, and you want to know if a user in admin or not, before checking of a user is whether admin or not use early return to check if first of the user exist.
2. Utilize Array Methods and Higher-Order Functions
the point here is to the readability and the expressivity of code, this can reduce the number of lines and decrease nested blocks
3. Splitting Long Lines
4. Use Unicorn Linter 
5. Extract Reusable Code
	Encapsulate Common logic can reduce lines of code and it's more maintainable
6. Limit Function complexity
	avoid long function which have excessive nesting levels. refactor your function to generally have 20-30 lines. function must do  one thing with a clear purpose
7. Use Helper Functions
8. Maintain Code File Size
	avoid large files with excessive lines of code to make it ease to navigate, understand and maintain. break down large file into smaller by making modular and focusing on single responsibilities
9. use ES6 as much as possible
10. Divide to Conquer
	- break down complex tasks into smaller
	- avoid handle everything in a single function
	- divide complex implementation into helper functions
	- avoid combining many conditions
11. write code for Humans
	- strive for clarity and readability
	- use meaningful variable names, function, class
12. Avoid Deep Nesting
	- minimize the levels of nesting
	- strive to keep nesting levels below three if possible
