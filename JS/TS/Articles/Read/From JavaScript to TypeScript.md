## Summary

as the author introduced this article, with TypeScript to be a superset of JavaScript however, JavaScript isn't perfect I guess because of it feature of dynamic typing which can introduce many error in many way whereby TypeScript comes in and play a role by being the JS superset, it adds on top on JavaScript features to help developers write better code, catch errors more easy before even code have been executed, and make debugging easier than JS. 

<h4 style="">What is TypeScript?</h4>
 TypeScript is used in development, means that it allows developers to manage, maintain and debug their code easily, by introducing features like static typing, classes, interfaces and much more. while in JS we spot error while the code is running TypeScript allow us to catch errors during development which save time and reduce bugs.

<h4 style="">Why TypeScript?</h4>
TypeScript provide numerous benefits over JS such as:

1. Improved Reliability by adding static typing we can avoid typos, undefined variable that can crash our app or behave unexpectedly.
2. Enhanced productivity by writing better code and faster using the enhanced tools provided by TypeScript
3. Easier scalability: feature like class, interface and modules can allow us to structure our code to be modular and well maintained in order to larger application as well as the generics and decorators allow use to be more flexible to create reusable code that cam handle different scenarios
4. compatibility: since it is a superset of JavaScript we can use the JS libraries or even frameworks in TS project without any issues

<h4 style="">TypeScript Features</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Static Type: helps catch error before runtime which provides better code completion and code navigation</li>
	<li>Class & Interfaces: allows devs to write OO code</li>
	<li>Modules: enable better code organization and reuse</li>
	<li>Enums: a set of named constants that make code readable and maintainable code</li>
	<li>Generics: allows devs to write more flexible and reusable code</li>
</ul>
