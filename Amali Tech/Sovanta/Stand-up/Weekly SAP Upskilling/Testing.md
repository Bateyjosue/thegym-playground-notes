## Mocking the db


Hi Kimon,

I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to reach out and ask for your advice on something important that's been on my mind. 
Since I joined Amali Tech, I haven't had the chance to work on any client projects yet. We've been upskilling, which I appreciate, but the process has been quite slow due to the lack of strong guidance. This has made it harder for us to progress, and at the same time, there's an expectation for us to reach certain levels quickly. 

To be honest, I’ve taken the initiative to focus on the tech stack we're upskilling on, which is SAP and while I’ve been doing well with it, I’m **still not entirely comfortable**.  On top of that, the overall environment has been tough in terms of culture fit, and I’m beginning to question if this is the right place for me long term.

I would really appreciate your perspective on this. Do you think it's worth sticking it out, or would it be better for me to start looking for another opportunity? You helped me land this role, and I trust your advice.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this further? I’d love to hear your thoughts.

Thank you so much, Kimon.
