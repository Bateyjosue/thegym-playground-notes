## Why Cloud Computing
1. It assets as programmatic resources to quickly set up and tear down resources

3. Pay-as-you-go to test and use the system without being fully committed

## Definition of cloud computing

2. Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
3. stop guessing capacity
4. Benefit from massive economies of scale
5. Increase speed and agility
6. Go global in minutes

## Deploying to the cloud
#### Deployment models include the following
- Infrastructure as a service(IaaS)[EC2, S3, RDS, Route 53]
- Platform as a service(PaaS)[AWS Elastic Beanstalk]
- Software as a service(PaaS)[video meeting sites, email sites, file sharing sites, messaging apps]
#### Deployment strategies include the following
- Cloud (migrate existing applications to the cloud, or you can design and build new applications in the cloud) [create an application that consists of virtual servers, databases and networking components that are fully in the cloud]
- Hybrid(connect cloud-based resources to on-promises infrastructure)[you have legacy applications that are better maintained on premises, or government regulations require your business to keep certain records on premises]
- On-premises(known as a private cloud deployment, resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools)[might have applications that run on technology that is fully kept in your on-premises data center]
> Each type of deployment model and strategy has a shared responsibility between you and the cloud service provider
