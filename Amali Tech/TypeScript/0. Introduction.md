**1.1 What is TypeScript?**

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft. It compiles to plain JavaScript and offers additional features that help developers write more robust and maintainable code.

**1.2 Key Features of TypeScript:**

- **Static Typing:** Unlike JavaScript, TypeScript uses static types, allowing you to catch errors early in the development process. This leads to more predictable and error-free code.
- **Type Inference:** TypeScript can infer types automatically, making the code cleaner and reducing the need for explicit type declarations.
- **Enhanced IDE Support:** TypeScript provides powerful tooling and autocompletion in modern IDEs, enhancing the developer experience.
- **ESNext Features:** TypeScript supports modern JavaScript features and future ECMAScript proposals, ensuring that you can use the latest syntax and features.
- **Interoperability:** TypeScript is fully interoperable with JavaScript, meaning you can gradually adopt it in existing projects without rewriting everything from scratch.

**1.3 Benefits of Using TypeScript:**

- **Improved Code Quality:** With static typing, many common errors can be detected at compile-time rather than at runtime, leading to fewer bugs and more reliable applications.
- **Better Refactoring:** TypeScript's type system and tooling support make refactoring large codebases easier and safer.
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** Static types provide a clear contract for function signatures and object structures, making it easier for teams to collaborate and understand each other's code.
- **Documentation:** Types serve as a form of documentation, making it easier for developers to understand what functions and methods are expected to do.

**1.4 Setting Up TypeScript:**

- **Installation:** To install TypeScript, you can use npm (Node Package Manager). The command is:
  ```bash
  npm install -g typescript
  ```
- **Configuration:** TypeScript uses a `tsconfig.json` file to configure the compiler options and project settings. A basic `tsconfig.json` might look like this:
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "target": "es6",
      "module": "commonjs",
      "strict": true,
      "outDir": "./dist",
      "rootDir": "./src"
    },
    "include": ["src/**/*"],
    "exclude": ["node_modules"]
  }
  ```
- **Compiling Code:** You can compile TypeScript code to JavaScript using the `tsc` command. For example:
  ```bash
  tsc
  ```

**1.5 Hello World Example:**

Here’s a simple TypeScript program to illustrate basic syntax and types:

```typescript
// src/index.ts

function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const user = 'World';
console.log(greet(user));
```

To compile and run this example:

1. Save the code in a file named `index.ts` inside a `src` directory.
2. Run `tsc` to compile the code.
3. Execute the compiled JavaScript file in the `dist` directory:
   ```bash
   node dist/index.js
   ```

### 0.1 TypeScript vs JavaScript

To understand the advantages of TypeScript, it's crucial to compare it with JavaScript. Both languages are used for web development, but TypeScript offers several enhancements over JavaScript.

**1.1.1 Overview:**

- **JavaScript:** A dynamic, loosely-typed scripting language primarily used for adding interactivity to web pages. It’s a core technology of the web, alongside HTML and CSS.
- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft that adds optional static typing and other features to JavaScript. TypeScript code is compiled to JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with existing JavaScript codebases and environments.

**1.1.2 Key Differences:**

- **Type System:**
  - **JavaScript:** Dynamically typed, meaning variable types are determined at runtime.
  - **TypeScript:** Statically typed, meaning variable types are known at compile-time. This helps catch errors early and makes code more predictable.

- **Development Experience:**
  - **JavaScript:** Basic editor support with syntax highlighting and simple code completion.
  - **TypeScript:** Enhanced editor support with features like type checking, code completion, refactoring tools, and navigation capabilities, which improve productivity and code quality.

- **Error Detection:**
  - **JavaScript:** Errors are typically discovered at runtime, which can lead to unexpected issues during execution.
  - **TypeScript:** Errors are detected during compilation, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors and enabling developers to catch issues early in the development process.

- **Code Maintainability:**
  - **JavaScript:** Lack of static types can make large codebases harder to maintain and refactor.
  - **TypeScript:** Static types and interfaces make it easier to understand, maintain, and refactor large codebases, especially in collaborative environments.

- **Modern JavaScript Features:**
  - **JavaScript:** Supports modern ECMAScript features, but may require transpilers like Babel for compatibility with older environments.
  - **TypeScript:** Supports all modern JavaScript features and future ECMAScript proposals, with additional type safety and features. TypeScript code is transpiled to compatible JavaScript for any environment.

**1.1.3 Benefits of TypeScript Over JavaScript:**

- **Enhanced Code Quality:** The type system helps catch errors early, leading to more robust and reliable code.
- **Better Tooling:** Integrated development environments (IDEs) and editors provide advanced features like autocompletion, refactoring, and inline documentation, improving the developer experience.
- **Scalability:** TypeScript’s static typing and interfaces make it easier to manage and scale large codebases.
- **Interoperability:** TypeScript code can seamlessly integrate with existing JavaScript libraries and frameworks, allowing for gradual adoption without rewriting existing code.

**1.1.4 When to Use TypeScript:**

- **Large Projects:** TypeScript is particularly beneficial for large codebases where static typing can significantly improve maintainability and collaboration.
- **Team Collaboration:** Teams can benefit from TypeScript’s clear type definitions and interfaces, making it easier for members to understand and work with each other’s code.
- **Long-Term Projects:** Projects that require long-term maintenance and updates benefit from the predictable and maintainable code that TypeScript facilitates.


### 0.2 TS and JS Interoperability

One of TypeScript's strengths is its seamless interoperability with JavaScript. This makes it easier to gradually adopt TypeScript in existing JavaScript projects without having to rewrite everything from scratch.

**1.2.1 Importing JavaScript into TypeScript:**

You can directly import and use JavaScript files in a TypeScript project. TypeScript will treat imported JavaScript as having the `any` type, allowing you to use JavaScript code without type errors.

```typescript
// Importing a JavaScript module
import { someFunction } from './someJavaScriptFile.js';

someFunction();
```

**1.2.2 Adding Type Definitions to JavaScript:**

To get better type safety and editor support when using JavaScript libraries or files, you can add type definitions. These definitions can be either created manually or obtained from DefinitelyTyped, a repository of high-quality TypeScript type definitions.

**Using DefinitelyTyped:**

```bash
npm install @types/lodash
```

Now, you can use Lodash with type support:

```typescript
import _ from 'lodash';

const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(_.shuffle(arr));
```

**Creating Custom Type Definitions:**

If no type definitions are available, you can create your own:

```typescript
// someJavaScriptFile.d.ts
declare module 'someJavaScriptFile' {
  export function someFunction(): void;
}
```

**1.2.3 Using TypeScript in JavaScript Projects:**

You can incrementally adopt TypeScript in a JavaScript project by renaming `.js` files to `.ts` or `.tsx` and fixing type errors gradually. This allows teams to transition to TypeScript at their own pace.

**1.2.4 Configuring the Compiler:**

The `tsconfig.json` file allows fine-tuned control over the interoperability between TypeScript and JavaScript:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowJs": true,        // Allows JavaScript files to be compiled
    "checkJs": true,        // Enables type checking in JavaScript files
    "outDir": "./dist",     // Output directory for compiled files
    "rootDir": "./src"      // Root directory of source files
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

**1.2.5 Practical Example:**

Imagine you have a legacy JavaScript project and you want to start using TypeScript. Begin by creating a `tsconfig.json` file and enabling `allowJs`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowJs": true,
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src"
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

Now, you can start converting files to TypeScript one by one:

```javascript
// src/legacy.js
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

module.exports = greet;
```

Rename to `greet.ts` and add types:

```typescript
// src/greet.ts
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

export default greet;
```


### 0.3 Installation and Configuration

Setting up TypeScript in your development environment is straightforward. This section covers the steps to install TypeScript, configure the compiler, and set up the `tsconfig.json` file to tailor the compilation process to your project's needs.

**1.3.1 Installation:**

TypeScript can be installed globally or locally in a project using npm (Node Package Manager).

- **Global Installation:**

  Installing TypeScript globally allows you to use the `tsc` command from anywhere in your system.

  ```bash
  npm install -g typescript
  ```

- **Local Installation:**

  Installing TypeScript locally in your project keeps the TypeScript version consistent for that specific project.

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev typescript
  ```

  You can then run the TypeScript compiler using `npx`:

  ```bash
  npx tsc
  ```

**1.3.2 tsconfig.json:**

The `tsconfig.json` file is used to configure the TypeScript compiler options. This file is typically placed in the root directory of your project.

- **Basic Configuration:**

  A minimal `tsconfig.json` file might look like this:

  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "target": "es6",          // Specify ECMAScript target version
      "module": "commonjs",     // Specify module code generation
      "strict": true,           // Enable all strict type-checking options
      "outDir": "./dist",       // Redirect output structure to the directory
      "rootDir": "./src"        // Specify the root directory of input files
    },
    "include": ["src/**/*"],    // Specify files to include
    "exclude": ["node_modules"] // Specify files to exclude
  }
  ```

**1.3.3 Compiler Options:**

The `compilerOptions` in the `tsconfig.json` file control how the TypeScript compiler behaves. Here are some commonly used options:

- **target:** Determines the ECMAScript version for the output JavaScript. Common values are `es5`, `es6`, `esnext`, etc.
  
  ```json
  "target": "es6"
  ```

- **module:** Specifies the module system for the generated code. Common values are `commonjs`, `amd`, `esnext`, etc.
  
  ```json
  "module": "commonjs"
  ```

- **strict:** Enables strict type-checking options, which include `noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`, `strictFunctionTypes`, etc.
  
  ```json
  "strict": true
  ```

- **outDir:** Specifies the output directory for the compiled JavaScript files.
  
  ```json
  "outDir": "./dist"
  ```

- **rootDir:** Specifies the root directory of input files. This helps maintain the folder structure in the output directory.
  
  ```json
  "rootDir": "./src"
  ```

- **include and exclude:** Control which files are included in or excluded from the compilation process.
  
  ```json
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
  ```

**1.3.4 Practical Example:**

Here’s a practical example of setting up a TypeScript project:

1. **Initialize npm:**

   Create a new directory for your project and initialize npm:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-typescript-project
   cd my-typescript-project
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Install TypeScript:**

   Install TypeScript as a development dependency:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev typescript
   ```

3. **Create tsconfig.json:**

   Create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your project:

   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "target": "es6",
       "module": "commonjs",
       "strict": true,
       "outDir": "./dist",
       "rootDir": "./src"
     },
     "include": ["src/**/*"],
     "exclude": ["node_modules"]
   }
   ```

4. **Create Source Directory:**

   Create the `src` directory and add a TypeScript file:

   ```bash
   mkdir src
   ```

   ```typescript
   // src/index.ts
   function greet(name: string): string {
     return `Hello, ${name}!`;
   }

   const user = 'World';
   console.log(greet(user));
   ```

5. **Compile TypeScript:**

   Compile the TypeScript files to JavaScript:

   ```bash
   npx tsc
   ```

   This command generates the JavaScript files in the `dist` directory.

6. **Run the Compiled Code:**

   Execute the compiled JavaScript file:

   ```bash
   node dist/index.js
   ```

Here's a note for the remaining points on your TypeScript roadmap regarding running TypeScript and related tools:
