In TypeScript, types play a crucial role in defining the shape of data and ensuring type safety within your code. This chapter explores various TypeScript types and their usage.

### 1.1 Assertions

Type assertions allow you to override the default inferred type or specify a more specific type for a value.

**1. `as const`:**
- Asserts that a variable is a constant value.
  ```typescript
  const name = 'John' as const;
  ```

**2. `as [type]`:**
- Allows casting a value to a specific type.
  ```typescript
  const numberString = '123' as number;
  ```

**3. `as any`:**
- Bypasses TypeScript's type checking, treating the variable as any type.
  ```typescript
  const data: any = fetchData();
  ```

### 1.2 Non-null Assertion

The non-null assertion (`!`) tells TypeScript that a variable is not null or undefined.

```typescript
let value!: string; // value will be assigned later
value = 'Hello TypeScript!';
```

### 1.3 `satisfies` Keyword

The `satisfies` keyword checks if a type satisfies a condition, primarily used in conditional types.

```typescript
type IsString<T> = T satisfies string ? true : false;
```

### 1.4 Primitive Types

TypeScript includes several built-in primitive types:

- **boolean:** Represents true or false values.
- **number:** Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
- **string:** Represents textual data.
- **void:** Represents the absence of a value, commonly used as the return type of functions that don't return anything.
- **undefined:** Represents a variable that has not been assigned a value.
- **null:** Represents an intentional absence of any object value.

### 1.5 Object Types

Object types in TypeScript allow you to define the structure of objects.

**1. Interface:**
- Defines a contract for objects, specifying the properties and their types.
  ```typescript
  interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
  }
  ```

**2. Class:**
- Defines object types using classes with constructors and methods.
  ```typescript
  class Car {
    constructor(public brand: string, public model: string) {}
  }
  ```

**3. Enum:**
- Defines a set of named constants, often used for representing a group of related values.
  ```typescript
  enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
  }
  ```

**4. Array:**
- Represents a collection of elements of the same type.
  ```typescript
  const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
  ```

**5. Tuple:**
- Represents an array with a fixed number of elements where each element has a specific type.
  ```typescript
  const tuple: [string, number] = ['John', 30];
  ```

### 1.6 Other Types

**1. any:**
- Represents a dynamic type that can hold any value.
  ```typescript
  let data: any = 10;
  data = 'Hello';
  ```

**2. object:**
- Represents any non-primitive type, excluding `null` and `undefined`.
  ```typescript
  let obj: object = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
  ```

**3. unknown:**
- Represents a type-safe counterpart of `any`, where type checking is required before using the value.
  ```typescript
  let userInput: unknown;
  if (typeof userInput === 'string') {
    const strLength = userInput.length; // Type check required
  }
  ```

**4. never:**
- Represents a type that never occurs, often used as the return type of functions that never return.
  ```typescript
  function throwError(message: string): never {
    throw new Error(message);
  }
  ```
