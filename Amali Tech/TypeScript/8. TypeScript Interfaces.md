This chapter delves into TypeScript interfaces, including their usage, differences from types, extending interfaces, interface declarations, and hybrid types.

### 8.1 TypeScript vs Interfaces

In TypeScript, both types and interfaces can be used to define shapes of objects, but there are some differences:

- **Interfaces:** Interfaces are mainly used for defining object shapes and contracts. They can also be extended and implemented by classes.
- **Types:** Types can represent a wider range of data structures, including unions, intersections, and more complex types. They are more versatile but cannot be extended or implemented directly.

#### Example: Using Interfaces

```typescript
// Interface
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

// Type
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};

// Interface extending Type
interface NamedPoint extends Point {
  name: string;
}
```

### 8.2 Extending Interfaces

Interfaces in TypeScript can extend other interfaces, allowing for code reuse and composition.

#### Example: Extending Interfaces

```typescript
interface Shape {
  color: string;
}

interface Circle extends Shape {
  radius: number;
}

interface Rectangle extends Shape {
  width: number;
  height: number;
}

const circle: Circle = { color: 'red', radius: 10 };
const rectangle: Rectangle = { color: 'blue', width: 20, height: 30 };
```

### 8.3 Interface Declaration

Interface declaration is a way to define the structure of an object without explicitly creating a named interface.

#### Example: Interface Declaration

```typescript
function printLabel(labeledObj: { label: string }) {
  console.log(labeledObj.label);
}

let myObj = { size: 10, label: 'Size 10 Object' };
printLabel(myObj); // Output: Size 10 Object
```

### 8.4 Hybrid Types

Hybrid types in TypeScript combine properties and methods in a single interface, allowing objects to have both shape and behavior.

#### Example: Hybrid Type

```typescript
interface Counter {
  count: number;
  increment(): void;
}

function createCounter(): Counter {
  let count = 0;

  let counter: Counter = {
    count,
    increment() {
      count++;
    },
  };

  return counter;
}

let myCounter = createCounter();
myCounter.increment();
console.log(myCounter.count); // Output: 1
```
