Type inference in TypeScript allows the compiler to automatically determine the type of a variable based on its value. This chapter explores how type inference works and its benefits.

### 3.1 Basics of Type Inference

Type inference in TypeScript is primarily based on the following principles:

- **Type of Literal Values:** TypeScript infers types from literal values such as strings, numbers, and booleans.
- **Contextual Typing:** TypeScript uses the context in which a variable or expression is used to infer its type.
- **Type Annotations:** Explicit type annotations provided by developers override type inference.

### 3.2 Examples of Type Inference

#### Example 1: Literal Values

```typescript
let name = 'John'; // Type inferred as string
let age = 30; // Type inferred as number
let isActive = true; // Type inferred as boolean
```

#### Example 2: Contextual Typing

```typescript
function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const message = greet('Alice'); // Type of message inferred as string
```

#### Example 3: Type Annotations vs. Type Inference

```typescript
let numberOrString: number | string; // Type annotation

numberOrString = 10; // Type inferred as number
numberOrString = 'Hello'; // Type inferred as string
```

### 3.3 Benefits of Type Inference

Type inference brings several advantages to TypeScript development:

- **Reduced Boilerplate:** Developers write less code by relying on the compiler to infer types.
- **Improved Readability:** Code becomes more concise and easier to understand without explicit type annotations everywhere.
- **Flexibility:** Type inference works well with dynamic and changing data types, providing flexibility in code development.
