@everyone This week and next week up to Wednesday or Thursday you will focus on React using this curriculum [https://www.notion.so/React-e72ad23fec8e469f9c0c7982eae9348b](https://www.notion.so/React-e72ad23fec8e469f9c0c7982eae9348b "https://www.notion.so/React-e72ad23fec8e469f9c0c7982eae9348b") You should finish the fundamentals course by the end of this week **but of course, don't rush. Go deep as always. Stop the video to do what they show you etc.** By Monday next week at the latest, you should do the exercises.
