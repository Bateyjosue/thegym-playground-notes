1. @everyone next week you will not have time to continue with the React curriculum, you need to move on to React Router. So if there are any React exercises left that you have not completed yet, try to complete them by the end of this weekend. (Peer-reviews can happen next week, that's fine. But the initial exercises need to be finished by the end of the weekend
    
    From Monday onwards go through this course [https://www.notion.so/React-Router-718e6f1cc892435e99b0a4825fb22bd7](https://www.notion.so/React-Router-718e6f1cc892435e99b0a4825fb22bd7 "https://www.notion.so/React-Router-718e6f1cc892435e99b0a4825fb22bd7"). You have till the end of next week to finish it, however the challenge will be that most of the time of next week will be devoted to various sessions with Matthias, Anna and Vic. So there won't be much time for the React Router course, that's why you'll definitely need the full week. Any peer-reviews and re-work of your React exercises will have priority over the React Router course next week.
