@everyone you had a deadline to submit your finalized last week and have them final enough to be delivered to your colleagues by the end of Friday. But a few of you have not done so yet ![üßê](https://discordapp.com/assets/ece6283544a703f158b497507aae3b62.svg) Please don't miss such deadlines. I know it's challenging to do such things next to a tight schedule of studying. But it's important that you learn how to do it. So please, if you haven't done so yet, finalize your feedbacks with the help of your coaches tonight or tomorrow morning and deliver it to the feedback recipient by tomorrow evening. **Additionally I want to ask everyone to prepare another round of feedback using the same system as last time by tomorrow evening. Send it to your coaches again for review.** The goal is that this second feedback is finalized by Friday evening and delivered to the recipients on Monday. Please stick to these deadlines and don't force me to follow up about the task again...
