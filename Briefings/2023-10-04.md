@everyone Yesterday you had a chance to get to know Anna and Vic. Remember that they are here as your trainers. They are not assessing you. So use them as trainers. Ask them questions, use their knowledge and experience to grow yourselves. 

**Today**'s sessions will be: Morning (starting at around 10am) product ideation workshop Afternoon (starting at around 3pm) writing user stories (that's what the tickets are called, that the developers get) After that session we will have conversation groups 1 & 2 and then 3 & 4 talking to Vic and Anna in our usual small circles. 

**Tomorrow**. **We start at 9am**, so be here at 8.30am at the latest 9-10 UI Design 10-12 Introduction to Agile Meetings After that we will have all conversation groups do their small circle meetings with Anna and Vic. (By the end of tomorrow each conversation group will have had one meeting with Anna and one meeting with Vic) 

**Friday** In the morning you will do a laptop-setup-session with your coaches and Anna will later join to help with any problems. In the afternoon you will have a remote session with Matthias, who couldn't come this week because he is sick, where he will introduce himself and you get to ask him questions. If there is enough time he will also give you a few briefings on technological topics related to the Moni Share project.
