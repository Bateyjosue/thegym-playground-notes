@everyone regarding the **react curriculum:** The volume of the course is quite high if you have never used React before. Nevertheless, you need to try to get through it and understand it in depth by the end of this weekend, so that on Monday you can start the exercises. This is going to be a challenge for those of you who have never used React before. My advise is:

- if you are stuck on some topic, don't stay stuck for more than 20 minutes. Ask your fellow teammates or your coaches for help. You simply don't have enough time to stay stuck on topics and try to figure it out alone right now.
- try to use extra time both during the week and on the weekend to manage to get through as much content as possible.

Regarding the **feedbacks:** Make sure you send the edited feedbacks back to your trainers **by the end of the day today.** As soon as your feedback has received a final approval (for some of you this may already have happened, for others it will happen tomorrow at the latest) approach the person you prepared the feedback for, take them to a quiet corner of the garden and share your feedback with them. You will share your feedback with the feedback recipient verbally, not in writing. **All feedbacks should be given to their recipients by the end of tomorrow.**
