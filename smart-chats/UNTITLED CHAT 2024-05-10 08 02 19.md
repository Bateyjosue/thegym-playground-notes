The first steps of development for a project involve adding fonts and colors used in Figma to the project, creating small reusable components such as buttons and input fields, and creating the general layout of the project. The contribution rules and git flow for the project include branching, committing, PRs, code review, and resolving conflicts. CSS rules for the project include using rem units, avoiding using squash commits, and avoiding merging other dependencies PRs into the ones being worked on. The tailwind config for the project should follow the original format and style that tailwindcss uses. Tailwindcss should be used to calculate spacing values, and custom attributes such as `w-1`, `gap-1`, `space-x-2`, `w-1`, `p-2`, and `m-2` should be customized under the `spacing` attributes in the tailwind config to avoid duplication in different class utilities that need them. Image optimizations should be used to load images faster and without quality loss, and special characters such as opening and closing quotes and soft hyphens should be used correctly. QA should be done before submitting a PR for review, and the color naming format should follow a specific suffix naming convention.
