hey,
summize for me the following paragraphs
SAP BTP is an open set of Software, Platform, and Infrastructure as a Service system that delivers in-memory capabilities, core platform services, and unique micro-services for building and extending intelligent, mobile, and browser enabled applications. SAP BTP is multilingual, with support for most major languages (now including ABAP) and support for development, testing, and production systems both inside an organization and to the larger public.
SAP BTP is also constantly evolving. SAP continuously updates the services we provide, the platforms that run the custom code, and the infrastructure that supports everything. This allows developers to focus on the custom code, and not worry about hardware maintenance or software upgrades. SAP BTP offers you the ability to turn data into business value, compose end-to-end business processes, and build and extend SAP applications quickly.
The central point of entry to the platform is SAP BTP cockpit, where you can access your accounts and applications and manage all activities associated with them.
