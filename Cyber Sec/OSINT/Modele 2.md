### What is OSINT
	Is data collected from publicly available sources to be used in a intelligence context. -Wikipedia
	Produced from publicly availanble information that is collected, exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to  an appropriate audience for the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence requirement. -U.S Department of Defence

### The OSINT Cycles

represent the process of developing and transferring the raw 
 information into finish intelligence to be using in their decision making

1. Planning: describe what you are looking for. indentify requirement. Define the objectives and scope of the OSINT operation. Determine the type of information needed and establish methods for finding relevant source
2. Gathering: Gather publicly available information from various online sources such as news articles, social media, blogs, and forums. Use tools and techniques suitable for the type of data being sought.
3. Analyzing: Analyze the processed data to uncover patterns, trends, and connections. Utilize data visualization, data mining, and natural language processing to derive meaningful insights.
4. Dissemination: reporting the gathered information. should be peer reviewed to ensure objectivity. Share the findings with stakeholders through reports, presentations, or alerts. Ensure the information is presented in a clear and actionable manner.
5. Feedback:  Collect feedback on the effectiveness of the OSINT operation. Use this feedback to refine future operations, improving the quality of data collection, processing, and analysis.

The OSINT cycle is iterative, meaning that each phase is revisited and improved upon with each new piece of information and feedback received. This continuous improvement ensures that the OSINT process remains effective and adaptable to changing circumstances.
