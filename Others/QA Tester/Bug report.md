During the test we have prepared, you are going to be asked questions on the information listed below.  

## **How to write a bug report**

Below is a short summary of what to include for each component of a full bug report.

### Clear Title

- A moderator should be able to understand what the bug report is about from the title alone.

### One bug per report

- Report one bug in a single report. If you put in more than one many bug it may be overlooked, and will not be eligible for payment.

### Actual results

- This section should expand on the title by stating the behavior observed when the issue occurs.

### Expected results

- The Expected Results section should state how the app should behave according to its intended behaviour. 
    

_E.g: The authorisation phase completes successfully, the user is logged into the newly created account and redirected to the home page of the app._  

###  Steps to reproduce:

- The Steps to Reproduce section should list each step required to reproduce the bug in chronological order.

### Severity of the bug

- We use 5 categories to identify the severity of the bug.
    - **Critical** -  The bug prevents critical functionality within the app from working. This includes crashing, freezing for which no workaround is possible and a fix is required immediately.
    - **High** - The bug affects major functionality within the app from working. However, high priority bugs can be avoided with a workaround.
    - **Medium** - The bug does not cause a failure and does not interfere with the fluent work of the system and programs. It has an easy workaround.
    - **Low** - The bug does not affect functionality or data, or require a workaround.  It is a result of non-conformance to a standard that does not impact productivity (e.g. typing errors/ aesthetic inconsistencies, etc.).
    - **Usability** - A suggestion that would improve how an app is understood, learnt and used efficiently.  

### Device and Operating System

- Each bug report must include details of the specific device and operating system you used during the test to  identify the bug.

### Other Notes/Error Messages

- Include necessary and relevant evidence to show the problem you are describing. Evidence includes: screenshots, videos, crash or console logs (for crashes).
- Crashes and freezes should always include a video and console/crash logs. 
- Bugs with more than one step to reproduce usually require a video.
