# How to write the code
## Components of C++ structure
1. **standard libraries section**
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
```
> `#include` is a pre-processor command that includes all the files of a library specified within a angular brackets
> `<iostream>` is a standard files that contains all the files required for displaying and taking inputs from the user.
> `Namespace` is used to avoid the collision between the similar functions names or variable names
2. main function section
```cpp
int main() {
	return 0;
}
```
> The main function is the starting function of all the C++ programs
3. function body section
```cpp
int main() {
	// boddy statments...
	return 0;
}
```
> the body of the function start and end with `{` and `}`
