Express.js is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. Express.js simplifies the process of writing server-side applications by providing a simple and flexible API for [routing], [middleware], and[ handling HTTP requests and responses.]

Here's a basic example of how to set up an Express.js application:

1. **Install Express.js**: First, you need to install Express.js using npm. Navigate to your project directory and run:

   ```sh
   npm install express
   ```

2. **Create an Express Application**: Create a new file, typically named `app.js`, and set up your Express application:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const port =  3000;

   // Define a route handler for the root URL
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Hello World!');
   });

   // Start the server
   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
   });
   ```

3. **Run the Application**: You can start your Express application by running:

   ```sh
   node app.js
   ```

   Alternatively, you can add a start script to your `package.json` file:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "node app.js"
   }
   ```

   And then start your application with:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

Express.js provides several features that make it a popular choice for web development:

- **Routing**: Express.js allows you to define routes for different HTTP methods and URLs.

- **Middleware**: You can use middleware functions to handle requests and responses, perform common tasks like logging, error handling, or parsing request bodies.

- **Template Engines**: Express.js supports template engines like Pug, EJS, and Handlebars, which allow you to generate dynamic HTML.

- **Static Files**: You can serve static files like images, CSS, and JavaScript directly from a directory.

- **Error Handling**: Express.js provides a built-in error handling mechanism.

Here's an example of an Express.js application that uses some of these features:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port =  3000;

// Middleware to parse JSON request bodies
app.use(express.json());

// Middleware to serve static files from the 'public' directory
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Route for the home page
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to the home page!');
});

// Route for user profile
app.get('/profile', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to your profile!');
});

// Error handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

Express.js is highly customizable and can be extended with various middleware and plugins to add additional functionality. It's a powerful tool for building web applications and APIs in Node.js.

### View engine
In Express.js, a view engine is a module that allows you to render views, which are templates that are used to generate HTML markup with dynamic data. View engines enable you to separate the application logic from the presentation logic, which is a good practice in web development.

Express.js supports a variety of view engines, each with its own syntax and features. Some popular view engines include:

- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: A simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
- **Pug (formerly Jade)**: A high-performance template engine heavily influenced by Haml and implemented with JavaScript for Node.js.
- **Handlebars**: A logic-less templating engine that uses a simple templating language to generate HTML.
- **Mustache**: A logic-less templating engine that can be used for HTML, config files, source code, etc.

To use a view engine in Express.js, you need to do the following:

1. **Install the View Engine**: First, you need to install the view engine package using npm. For example, to install EJS, you would run:

   ```sh
   npm install ejs
   ```

2. **Set the View Engine**: In your Express.js application, you need to set the view engine using the `app.set` method. For example, to set EJS as the view engine, you would do:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
   ```

3. **Configure the Views Directory**: By default, Express.js looks for views in a directory named `views` in the root of your project. You can change this directory by setting the `views` property:

   ```javascript
   app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'templates'));
   ```

4. **Render Views**: To render a view, you use the `res.render` method, passing the name of the view file (without the file extension) and an object containing the data to be passed to the view:

   ```javascript
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.render('index', { title: 'Home' });
   });
   ```

5. **Create View Files**: In your views directory, you create view files that correspond to the templates you want to render. For example, for EJS, you might have a file named `index.ejs` with the following content:

   ```ejs
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
     <title><%= title %></title>
   </head>
   <body>
     <h1>Welcome to <%= title %>!</h1>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

When a client makes a request to your Express.js application, the server will render the appropriate view using the view engine, passing in any data you've provided. The rendered HTML is then sent back to the client as the response.

Using a view engine in Express.js can greatly simplify the process of generating dynamic HTML and can make your code more maintainable and easier to understand.

### EJS

EJS, which stands for Embedded JavaScript, is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It is a view engine for Node.js applications, particularly those built with the Express.js framework. EJS is designed to be easy to use and to allow developers to embed JavaScript code directly into their HTML templates.

Here are some key features and details about EJS:

1. **Embedding JavaScript**: EJS allows you to embed JavaScript code directly into your HTML templates. This is done using `<% %>` tags for JavaScript code that doesn't output anything and `<%= %>` tags for JavaScript code that outputs a value.

2. **Control Structures**: EJS supports common control structures like loops (`for`, `while`) and conditionals (`if`, `else`). These are used to create dynamic content based on the data passed to the template.

3. **Partials**: EJS supports the use of partials, which are smaller, reusable pieces of HTML that can be included in other templates. This helps to keep your templates DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and makes it easier to manage common elements across multiple pages.

4. **Includes**: Similar to partials, EJS allows you to include other EJS files using the `<%- include('partialName') %>` syntax. This is useful for breaking up complex templates into smaller, more manageable pieces.

5. **Layouts**: EJS supports layouts, which are templates that define the common structure of your pages (like headers, footers, and navigation). You can define a layout and then extend it in your individual page templates.

6. **Custom Tags**: EJS allows you to define custom tags that can be used to create more readable and maintainable templates.

7. **Filters**: EJS supports filters, which are functions that can be used to modify the output of your templates.

8. **Whitespace Control**: EJS provides a way to control the whitespace in your templates, which can be useful for controlling the formatting of your HTML output.

Here's an example of how you might use EJS in an Express.js application:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Set EJS as the view engine
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // Render the 'index' view with some data
  res.render('index', { title: 'Home', message: 'Welcome to the home page!' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port  3000');
});
```

And here's what the corresponding `index.ejs` file might look like:

```ejs
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title><%= title %></title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1><%= message %></h1>
  <% if (user) { %>
    <p>Welcome, <%= user.name %>!</p>
  <% } else { %>
    <p>Please log in.</p>
  <% } %>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the `index.ejs` file uses EJS syntax to embed JavaScript code and output dynamic content based on the `title` and `message` variables passed to the `res.render` method.

EJS is a popular choice for server-side templating in Node.js applications due to its simplicity and ease of use. It allows developers to create dynamic HTML content without having to switch between languages or use complex templating syntax.

### Middleware

> Code which runs (on the server) between getting a request and sending a response

Middleware in Express.js is a function that has access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle, commonly denoted by a variable named `next` [0][1][2][4]. Middleware functions can perform various tasks, such as executing code, modifying the request and response objects, ending the request-response cycle, and calling the next middleware function in the stack [0][1][2][4].

Here's how you can use middleware in Express.js:

1. **Application-level Middleware**: Bind application-level middleware to an instance of the `app` object using the `app.use()` function. This middleware will be executed every time the app receives a request.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now());
  next();
});
```

2. **Router-level Middleware**: Similar to application-level middleware, but bound to an instance of `express.Router()`. This middleware is executed for requests handled by the router.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const router = express.Router();

router.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now());
  next();
});

// mount the router on the app
app.use('/', router);
```

3. **Middleware with Specific Path**: Middleware can be mounted on a specific path, and it will be executed for any type of HTTP request on that path.

```javascript
app.use('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Request Type:', req.method);
  next();
});
```

4. **Middleware Array**: Middleware can be declared in an array for reusability.

```javascript
function logOriginalUrl(req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl);
  next();
}

function logMethod(req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request Type:', req.method);
  next();
}

const logStuff = [logOriginalUrl, logMethod];
app.get('/user/:id', logStuff, (req, res, next) => {
  res.send('User Info');
});
```

5. **Skipping Middleware**: If you want to skip the rest of the middleware functions, you can call `next('router')` to pass control back out of the router instance.

```javascript
router.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.headers['x-auth']) return next('router');
  next();
});
```

Middleware functions are a powerful tool in Express.js for handling various aspects of the request-response cycle, such as logging, authentication, and modifying request and response objects.![[middleware.png]]

> the order of middleware matter so better be careful while defining them.

#### Middleware example
1. logger middleware to log details of every request
2. Authentication checks middleware for protected routes
3. Middleware to parse JSON data data from requests
4. Return 404 pages
