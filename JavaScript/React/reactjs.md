ReactJS, developed by Facebook, has revolutionized the way developers build web applications. It follows a component-based approach, where the user interface is divided into reusable components. Each component encapsulates its own logic and state, making it easier to manage and maintain the codebase. ReactJS also utilizes a virtual DOM (Document Object Model), which allows for efficient rendering and updating of the user interface

One of the main advantages of using ReactJS is its ability to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces. ReactJS uses a concept called "props" to pass data from one component to another, allowing for seamless communication between different parts of the application. Additionally, ReactJS provides a simple and intuitive way to handle user events, such as button clicks or form submissions, through event handlers.
