## Difference between Set and Array?
___
**Arrays**

- Ordered collection  
- Duplicates allowed  
- Mutable  
- Fixed size or dynamic  
- Commonly used for: Storing and accessing a collection of elements in a specific order.

**Set**

- Unordered collection  
- No duplicates  
- Accessed by iteration  
- Immutable  
- Dynamic size  
- Commonly used for: Checking for the presence of an element, removing duplicates from an array, or performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

## Difference between Map and Object
---

**Object**

- Keys limited to strings and symbols  
- Property access using dot notation or bracket notation  
- Prototype inheritance  
- length property
- Iteration using`for...in`, `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()` and `Object.entries()`  
- Mutable 

**Maps**

- Keys can be any data type  
- Key-value pairs order  
- Iteration has built in methods such as `.keys()`, `.values()`, `.entries()`  
- No prototype inheritance  
- Size property  
- Performance  
- Use cases: Maps are commonly used when you need to store arbitrary keys and want to maintain the order of insertion or easily iterate over the keys and values.
