## 1. When should you use React Context API over props drilling?
=="You should use React Context API over props drilling when you need to pass data through many levels of components. Props drilling can become cumbersome and error-prone when your component tree is deep. Context API simplifies this process, improves code maintainability, and reduces the likelihood of errors."==

## 2. What do you think are the limitations of React Context API?
 =="React Context API is a powerful tool, but it has limitations. Deeply nested contexts can impact performance because any change in a context value triggers a re-render of all components consuming that context. Additionally, overusing context for every piece of data in your app can make your code harder to maintain and understand."==
