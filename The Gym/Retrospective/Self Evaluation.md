### Calendar

Every morning once I react at the gym I start my planning on the google calendar and I plan accordingly depending on the task which can be edited mainly at the end of the day make them conform the time I have tracked.

==I still need to improve and be consistent to update according to the time tracked ==
### Typing

After the morning session warm up or after breakfast I do typing, I have managed to so finish the tipp10 lesson and I have decided to go back again to increase my of typing as well as error rate

==I need to improve on the speed and the error rate to perform well==
### Anki

I add card continuously as I'm learning new interesting things. and every morning after the breakfast or typing I revise my card for about 30min, 10 for English Deck and around 20 for Javascript/Typescript.
==I feel like I need another time for repetition because 30 min it is no enough the card have grown so i need find some other time maybe add 30 min or later after the normal time boxes==
### codewars

for around an hour and some minutes in the morning after Anki I found myself doing a codewars kata I'm ranked 5kyu and 431 points now.
I start my kata by reading the challenge I have to solve line by line by writing out the step in pseudocode, after solving it using pseudocode I now jump in the codewars and code it line by line.

==need to improve the time spending in a kata to keep my time boxes organized==


### Course
I usually take time to go through the material because i don't want to rush the so I go on my own pace by doing exercise and researching as well just in case of a new thing I have learned and it not clear
### Collaboration
overall experience in good we are all trying to help each other grow and learn as well learning so no one should be left behind.
