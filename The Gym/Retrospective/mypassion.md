I wanted to be an hacker so I joined Uni, few months ago I realized that I had a lot to learn the basic of computer science and other concept like Math, etc.

I also join the cisco training center to have clear understanding of how the data are transited from one end to the other and how it takes different form from the TCP/IP OSI model from the ARPNET model.

I finally fell in love with since when I have attended to my first programming course. my like programming was Data structure and algorithm but I could Enjoy because I wanted something more practice that why I Have had attended my first C programming course my heart couldn't contain my body. I was so excited about the concept whereby I can finally communicate to computer giving it a instruction and then it will respond to it, that was just Wow to me.

from then, I have became addict to  it, I like coding that is a fun fact about me and something I'm seeing myself not able to do any other thing which does not evolve coding. because coding is the one thing which make me become awake for the hole night over and over. apart from natural need I could code until infinity. 

But with all the nights I and hours I spent coding or navigate on internet trying to be update, I still fell not enough, why? Quid?

here comes thousands questions about that, didn't I make enough effort, do I need to make more Efforts or It not my thing as people say. I know I don't to have the same story like other but same time I feel bad about that, I start coding not because of the good money people are making but if It cannot pays my bills then what is it for? Quid?

So, from today I'm doing a retrospective and  try to understand the reason why behind this. so feel free to review my profile, resume and please guide me and help me to reach at the best version of myself. Thanks

## Refined One

I wanted to be a hacker, so I joined a university. However, I quickly realized that I had a lot to learn about the basics of computer science, mathematics, and various concepts. In my pursuit of knowledge, I also enrolled in a Cisco training center to gain a clear understanding of how data is transmitted from one end to the other, and how it evolves from the TCP/IP OSI model to the ARPNET model.

As I delved deeper into the world of technology, I found my true passion when I attended my first programming course. Among all the aspects of programming, data structures and algorithms stood out as my favorite. However, I yearned for something more practical, which led me to my first C programming course. The moment I communicated with the computer through code and witnessed its responses, I was captivated. It was a "wow" moment for me.

From that point on, I became addicted to coding. It became more than just a hobby; it was a way of life. I found myself fully immersed in the world of programming, spending countless nights awake, coding and exploring the vast expanse of the internet to stay updated. Yet, despite the hours and effort invested, I still felt like it wasn't enough. Why?

This question has been on my mind continuously. Have I not made enough effort? Do I need to push myself further? Is coding not truly my calling, as some suggest? I understand that everyone's journey is unique, but at the same time, I couldn't help but feel disheartened. I didn't start coding for the promise of a hefty paycheck, but if it can't pay my bills, then what's the purpose? Why?

So, starting today, I'm taking a step back to reflect on my journey. I want to understand the reasons behind my passion for coding and what drives me. I'm determined to refine my path and become the best version of myself in this field. Your guidance and advice are greatly appreciated as I embark on this introspective journey. Thank you.
