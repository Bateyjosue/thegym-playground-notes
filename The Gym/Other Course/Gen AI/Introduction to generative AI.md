Gen AI, is a type of AI technology that produce variance type of content text, image, audio and other data.

AI: is discipline, a branch of computer science that deal with the creation of intelligent agents which can learn autonomously

**AI** is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence

**ML:** is AI discipline, which gives computers the ability to learn without explicit programming![[ml.png]]

1. **Supervised Models:** we have label, learn from past label/examples to predict the future data

3. **Unsupervised Models:** not labeled, the raw data and seeing if it naturally falls into groups

### Gen ML

### Deep Learning

is a subset of ML. uses [Artificial Neural Networks] that allowing them to process more complex patterns than traditional machine learning. ANN are inspired from the human brain

#### Semi-supervised learning
here the [[Neural Network]] is train on a small amount of labeled data and large amount of unlabeled data. [[labeled]] data helps the [[NN]] to learn the basic and the [[unlabeled]] helps to generalize the new examples

[[generative AI]] is a subset of deep learning which it uses [[ANN]] can process both labeled and unlabeled data using supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised methods

[[LLMs]] (Large Language Models) is also a subset of Deep Learning
