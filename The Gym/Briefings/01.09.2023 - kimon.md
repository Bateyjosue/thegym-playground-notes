1. @everyone when you are done with the website (or while you are waiting for a re-review or similar) you can start with the next topic on your curriculum, which is Asynchronous and Event Based Programming. Use this udacity course as an introduction. As always, stick to the core learning techniques and don't limit yourself to this course [https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-promises--ud898](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-promises--ud898 "https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-promises--ud898")
    The next Gate assessment will happen after next week (so in around 10 days) and it will focus on Asynchronous and Event Based Programming.

    
    Here is some additional reading and some exercises on Creating Promises:
