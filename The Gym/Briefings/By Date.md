1hr codewars -> stick to the one hour time-box. If you don't finish your kata in this time-box continue it tomorrow.

After lunch: speaking muscles with your group

End-of-day sessions
After the end of day sessions: 20 minutes typing

Some of you will be having coderwars 1-on-1 coaching today.
The rest of the day, whenever you are not in one of the exercises mentioned above, go through the ES6 curriculum. Make sure to go deep. That doesn't mean getting lost in some strange detail. But it does mean gaining an under-the-hood understanding of the contents.

# 13.08.2023

**For this week and next, you will be doing the following standard exercises:**

- 20 minutes typing with the entire group, at the start and end of the day
- 30 minutes Anki repetitions with the entire group after the typing exercise. **If you haven't done so yet, make sure to create Anki-Cards for ES6. In general during all your learning, always create Anki-Cards, to ensure the knowledge stays in your long-term memory.** The 30 minutes should be used for repetitions, not for car-creation. Card-creation should be ongoing. If you have failed to create ES6 cards, come to the office early and create them before 9 or do so late in the evening, after 8pm.
- Speaking Muscles after lunch -> **make sure to focus on speaking loudly AND on imitating the pronounciation you are hearing.**
- 1 hour codewars -> do Typescript challenges. As always, start with simple challenges. **Make sure to stick to the one-hour limit. If you aren't done with a challenge at the end of the other, continue it the next day.**
- End of day meetings.
- Of course you are tracking your time as always. But there is one additional briefing: when you work on a project, always put the ticket number of the ticket you are working on at the start of your time-tracking description. No matter whether you are initially working on a ticket, or peer-reviewing someone else's tickets, or re-working a ticket after a code review. Always put the ticket number at the start of the time-tracking. (You will learn about ticket numbers when you set up your project board)
