# Do you have a good personality giving Feedback?

My own refection on giving feedback
- I'm direct on giving  feedback even though sometimes it sound harsh depending on how you are reacting to it
- I usually appreciating before pointing out the missed point
- suggesting better practices 
- always give fact about my feedback 
- sometimes I'm honest about the point you have missed out

# The Impact Format

A. <q><b>When you did/said</b></q>
	then the impact on me was

B. What actions could you 
C. take for your impact to be

**1. Current Behavior**
- Exactly which behaviors are you addressing?
- be 100% objective. Focus only on facts (as if you were video camera)
**2. Current Impact**
- what was the impact of his/her behaviors?
- Focus on your personal and subjective response to the behavior
- describe the "Cost" (this could be emotional, effort, financial) of their behavior
**3. Desired future Impact
- What impact do you expect from their behavior in the future?
- Don't tell them what to do. Give them an invitation to think for themselves what new actions/behaviors could have the desired impact.

#### Exercise

1. You are not using the best practice which is making our code base look ugly
2. the function  `fetchMovies()` you have created to get all movies from the API looks good and performant but writing it along with DOM element manipulation make the code base a bit longer it could be good to add it to the modules so that it can be imported as other function for the code readability and reusability
3. The `fetchMovies()` function you've developed to retrieve movies from the API appears to be well-designed and efficient. However, when combined with DOM element manipulation, the codebase becomes somewhat long to navigate and hard to reuse. To enhance code readability and reusability, I would recommend encapsulating this function in a separate module that can be imported as needed.
