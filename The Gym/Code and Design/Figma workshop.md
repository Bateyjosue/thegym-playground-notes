### Difference Between UI & UX

**UI** stands for **User Interface** and refers to the visual design of an application or website. It includes all the elements that the user interacts with, such as buttons, forms, and menus. A good **UI** design should be visually appealing and easy to navigate, allowing users to complete tasks quickly and efficiently.

**UX** stands for **User Experience** and refers to the overall experience of using an application or website. It encompasses all aspects of the user's interaction with the product, including the UI design, the functionality, and the ease of use. A good UX design should be intuitive and seamless, providing a positive experience that encourages users to return.

In short, **UI** refers to the design of the product's interface, while **UX** refers to the overall experience of using the product. Both are important considerations in creating a successful product.
