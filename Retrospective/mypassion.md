I wanted to be an hacker so I joined Uni, few months ago I realized that I had a lot to learn the basic of computer science and other concept like Math, etc.

I also join the cisco training center to have clear understanding of how the data are transited from one end to the other and how it takes different form from the TCP/IP OSI model from the ARPNET model.

I finally fell in love with since when I have attended to my first programming course. my like programming was Data structure and algorithm but I could Enjoy because I wanted something more practice that why I Have had attended my first C programming course my heart couldn't contain my body. I was so excited about the concept whereby I can finally communicate to computer giving it a instruction and then it will respond to it, that was just Wow to me.

from then, I have became addict to  it, I like coding that is a fun fact about me and something I'm seeing myself not able to do any other thing which does not evolve coding. because coding is the one thing which make me become awake for the hole night over and over. apart from natural need I could code until infinity. 

But with all the nights I and hours I spent coding or navigate on internet trying to be update, I still fell not enough, why? Quid?

here comes thousands questions about that, didn't I make enough effort, do I need to make more Efforts or It not my thing as people say. I know I don't to have the same story like other but same time I feel bad about that, I start coding not because of the good money people are making but if It cannot pays my bills then what is it for? Quid?

So, from today I'm doing a retrospective and  try to understand the reason why behind this. so feel free to review my profile, resume and please guide me and help me to reach at the best version of myself. Thanks
