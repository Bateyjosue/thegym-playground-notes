		Hi Josh, I wanted to share some feedback regarding our recent project. We encountered issues related to inconsistent HTML formatting, improper nesting of elements, and varying naming conventions, leading to more code reviews than necessary. Addressing these concerns can help us streamline our development process in future projects. Let's work together to improve our HTML practices and create more efficient workflows. Thanks!
